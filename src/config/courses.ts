Planning and control topics will cover vehicle dynamics models, state-lattice planning, sampling-based kinodynamic planning, optimal control and trajectory optimization, and some reinforcement learning. Evaluation will involve ambitious challenge projects implemented on a physical vehicle. 4 graduate hours. No professional credit. Prerequisite: CS 374, ECE 374, ECE 484, or equivalent.",
